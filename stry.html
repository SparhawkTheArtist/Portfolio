        <p>The best things in life are as follows (in no particular order): nature, birds, books, fantasy, sci-fi, banana bread, any other bread, music, chocolate, art, and rain.</p>
        <p>Let's talk about the art. I'm an artist. That's why I call myself <em>Sparhawk the Artist</em>. But, more importantly, I am a designer, and an illustrator. I decided to be a designer so that I could create things that people could enjoy, but that would also have a use and a meaning. My favorite things to create are things people can hold and interact with, like playing cards.</p>
        <p>In addition, I love working on brands, because a brand is something that is used over and over and over, and over, AND OVER. A brand isn't thrown away upon use, it never needs to be recycled, it doesn't create waste.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a family where organic was gold and homegrown was even better. Both of my parents are wildlife biologists and nature enthusiasts, and I am by proxy an environmentalist. If I hadn't become a designer, I would be staring at neat little birds right now, trying to figure out what species they are.</p>
        <p>This is a key ingredient in my design, as well as my motivation for being a designer. Half of the stuff I create (whether it be logos or illustrations or just sketchbook page-fillers) has to do with nature, and the environment, and specifically trying to capture the beauty and wonder that it holds. Being environmentally friendly is one of the main tenets of my design philosophy.</p>
        <p>Besides illustration and design, I spend a lot of time playing guitar and being outdoors (with a camera or a pair of binoculars, or a bike, it depends on the mood). I love reading (fantasy and sci-fi are like, the best things in the world (or maybe it should be the best things <em>not</em> in this world...?)), listening to space rock, and playing DnD with some crazy weird (but awesome) people.</p>
        <p>I began studying design in 2016 at Eastern Washington University, and have just completed the Bachelor of Design program.</p>
        <p>My passion is in illustration and layout design, but I have some experience in motion, photography, web, and UX.</p>
